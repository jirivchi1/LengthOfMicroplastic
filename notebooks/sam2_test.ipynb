    "SAM2 Segmentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Used Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) to generate a mask of the white area in the image using the mask_generator.generate() function. The results were stored in the sam2_result variable.\n",
    "Mask Inversion:\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the goal was to calculate the length of the black area (the area not covered by the mask), the mask was inverted using inverted_mask = np.logical_not(mask). This effectively swapped the white and black areas in the mask.\n",
    "Applying Closing Morphological Operation\n",
    "\n",
    "To fill holes and smooth the contours of the inverted mask (the black area), a closing operation was performed using OpenCV's cv2.morphologyEx with cv2.MORPH_CLOSE. This is essential to ensure the skeletonization process yields a more accurate representation of the area's length.\n",
    "Skeletonization:\n",
    "\n",
    "The skeleton of the processed inverted mask was computed using skeleton = skeletonize(closed > 0) from the skimage.morphology module. The skeleton represents the essential, thin lines capturing the length of the area of interest.\n",
    "Length Calculation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of pixels belonging to the skeleton was counted using np.sum(skeleton). This pixel count was then converted to micrometers using a conversion factor specific to your image (you provided 400 / 300 in your original code).\n",
    "Visualization:\n",
    "\n",
    "The original image and the calculated skeleton with the length in micrometers were displayed side-by-side for easy comparison.\n",
    "Steps Taken:\n",
    "\n",
    "Access Mask from SAM2 Output: The segmentation mask (sam2_result[0]['segmentation']) was extracted from the sam2_result.\n",
    "Invert the Mask: The np.logical_not() function was used to invert the mask, obtaining the black area's representation.\n",
    "Apply Closing Operation: OpenCV function was used for processing the image before skeletonization. This was to remove holes inside the object and smooth contours for better skeletonization.\n",
    "Skeletonize the Mask: skeletonize function from skimage.morphology was employed to obtain the skeleton.\n",
    "Calculate Length: The number of pixels in the skeleton was converted into length in micrometers using a conversion factor.\n",
    "Visualize Results: matplotlib.pyplot was used to display the results, showing both the original image and the calculated skeleton with length information."
